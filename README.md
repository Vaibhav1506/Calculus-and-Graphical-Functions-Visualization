## Limitations
While our project successfully performs a variety of well-known tasks and adheres to standard practices, it is not without its share of issues and limitations. Some of these are even highlighted in the rules when the code is run while some are outlined below:-

- It only accepts linear specific functions of the form "f(ax + c)" (sometimes "b" for inverse trigonometric functions). Thus it does not support sophisticated or implicit or complex functions and is very limited.
- It cannot perform complex integrations like the Gaussian Integrals or the Bernoulli's Integrals or multivariable calculus either.
- For Definite Integration of Inverse Trigonometric Function sometimes the answer may not show up due to Function Domain Error issues.
- For Polynomial Graphs it cannot display the polynomials which have complex roots properly.

## Output
The general first thing which you will notice after running the code is this :-

![Screenshot 2023-11-21 233145](https://github.com/Vaibhav1506/Calculus-Functions-Visualization-Python-MySql-Connectivity-Project/assets/74455023/6e336bc2-52b0-43a3-bd84-161dc3008d49)

Here you have to enter the given 3 parameters - hostname, username and password of your MySql database after accepting to run the code by entering "Y" or "y". Clearly there are 5 basic operations - Differentiation, Indefinite Integrals, Definite Integrals, Graphs and Exit. The user can enter the choice number and it further divides into operation type which consists of 5 basic mathematical expressions - Trigonometric, Inverse Trigonometric, Polynomial, Logarithmic and Exponential functions. This is only for the first 3 operations while for the 4th one there are 2 choices - One specifically for polynomials and other for universal (implicit / explicit functions).

1) For example here is the Differentiation part:

2) Now here is an Indefinite Integral part:

![Screenshot 2023-11-21 213248](https://github.com/Vaibhav1506/Calculus-Functions-Visualization-Python-MySql-Connectivity-Project/assets/74455023/f2661d4d-6cee-41e0-9050-20a6471f07e3)

3) Here is a Definit Integral part:

![Screenshot 2023-11-21 213205](https://github.com/Vaibhav1506/Calculus-Functions-Visualization-Python-MySql-Connectivity-Project/assets/74455023/72b0c3e8-ea05-44a7-83ed-0002e64f1bb4)

4) And here is the Graphing part (both choices):

![Screenshot 2023-11-21 232238](https://github.com/Vaibhav1506/Calculus-Functions-Visualization-Python-MySql-Connectivity-Project/assets/74455023/23b6191f-49a0-4323-b6e9-6ed7bfcbfb29)

![Screenshot 2023-11-21 213833](https://github.com/Vaibhav1506/Calculus-Functions-Visualization-Python-MySql-Connectivity-Project/assets/74455023/ae6e8dcd-af4e-4c3e-a968-d13af8fcd7c5)

Exiting the code will simply display:

Now for viewing the User History you can simply go to MySQL Command Line Client or Workbench (Latest Version 8.0).

![Screenshot 2023-11-23 201830](https://github.com/Vaibhav1506/Calculus-Functions-Visualization-Python-MySql-Connectivity-Project/assets/74455023/ee8f04e5-b12d-4e17-9f64-33c9c710231e)

![Output_X](https://github.com/Vaibhav1506/Calculus-and-Graphical-Functions-Visualization/assets/74455023/f3b0cc40-2dc3-4aa7-929a-e5a7aefea72b)

Therefore, you can see the results which the user has entered clearly in an organised and tabular format. (**Note**: The question marks are due to the fact that the Console / Client cannot display special characters like integrals & superscripts due to its encoding limitations.) 

## Changelogs and Version History
Contains various versions of the file from starting alongwith some details and descriptions about the code.The previous version files are availaible in the **Previous Versions** folder.

### Version 3.9 (6th August 2025)
1. Added extra functionalities for MySQL database.
2. Fixed redundancy in code.

### Version 3.8 (11th January 2024) [Latest Version]
1. Added Search Operation and Display User History and Datetime.

### Version 3.7 (17th December 2023)
1. Added link to this Github Repository for reference.

### Version 3.6 (24th November 2023)
1. Removed unnecessary comment lines "#type:ignore" (used previously for ignoring warnings).
2. Removed redundant guidelines and made it user - friendly.

### Version 3.5 (21st November 2023) 
1. Fixed an issue in Matplotlib display of any function entered by the user.
2. Fixed an error in displaying part of polynomial function as label and along y - axis in normal form in graphing part of the program.
3. Added Name Error Handling.
4. Added a Rule regarding entering of expressions in the Graphing part of program.
5. Added the expression entered in graphing part as answer to be inserted in database since using hyphens will result in duplication errors. This is due to the fact that the Answer column in the MySql database has UNIQUE constraint applied on it and since every graph will have hyphens as answer therefore we decided to change to the expresison entered by the user itself.
